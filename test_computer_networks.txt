Computer Networks - NPTEL Course

Chapter 1: Introduction to Computer Networks

A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices that can communicate and share resources. Networks can be classified based on their geographical coverage:

1. Local Area Network (LAN): Covers a small geographical area like a building or campus
2. Wide Area Network (WAN): Covers a large geographical area, often spanning cities or countries
3. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN): Covers a city or metropolitan area

Network Topologies:
- Bus Topology: All devices connected to a single communication line
- Star Topology: All devices connected to a central hub or switch
- Ring Topology: Devices connected in a circular fashion
- Mesh Topology: Every device connected to every other device

The OSI Model consists of 7 layers:
1. Physical Layer - Deals with physical transmission
2. Data Link Layer - Provides node-to-node delivery
3. Network Layer - Handles routing
4. Transport Layer - Provides end-to-end delivery
5. Session Layer - Manages sessions
6. Presentation Layer - Handles data encryption/decryption
7. Application Layer - Provides network services to applications

TCP/IP Protocol Suite:
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Reliable, connection-oriented protocol
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Unreliable, connectionless protocol
- IP (Internet Protocol): Handles addressing and routing
