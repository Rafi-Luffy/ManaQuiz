Data Structures and Algorithms - NPTEL Course

Module 1: Arrays and Linked Lists

Arrays:
An array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays provide constant time access to elements using indices.

Advantages of Arrays:
- Random access to elements (O(1) time complexity)
- Memory efficient storage
- Cache friendly due to locality of reference

Disadvantages of Arrays:
- Fixed size (in static arrays)
- Insertion and deletion operations are expensive (O(n))

Linked Lists:
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node contains data and a reference to the next node.

Types of Linked Lists:
1. Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node
2. Doubly Linked List: Each node has pointers to both next and previous nodes
3. Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node

Time Complexities:
- Access: O(n)
- Search: O(n)
- Insertion: O(1) at beginning, O(n) at arbitrary position
- Deletion: O(1) at beginning, O(n) at arbitrary position

Sorting Algorithms:
1. Bubble Sort - O(n²) time complexity
2. Selection Sort - O(n²) time complexity
3. Insertion Sort - O(n²) time complexity
4. Merge Sort - O(n log n) time complexity
5. Quick Sort - O(n log n) average case, O(n²) worst case

Binary Search:
Binary search works on sorted arrays and has O(log n) time complexity.

a) Only data
