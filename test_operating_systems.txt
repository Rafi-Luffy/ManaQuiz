Chapter 3: Process Management

A process is a program in execution. It includes the program code (text section), current activity (program counter and processor registers), stack, and data section.

Process States:
1. New: Process is being created
2. Ready: Process is waiting to be assigned to a processor
3. Running: Instructions are being executed
4. Waiting: Process is waiting for some event to occur
5. Terminated: Process has finished execution

Process Control Block (PCB):
Contains information about a process:
- Process ID (PID)
- Process state
- CPU registers and program counter
- CPU scheduling information
- Memory management information
- I/O status information

CPU Scheduling Algorithms:
1. First-Come-First-Served (FCFS): Non-preemptive, processes served in arrival order
2. Shortest Job First (SJF): Non-preemptive, shortest execution time first
3. Round Robin (RR): Preemptive, time quantum based
4. Priority Scheduling: Processes scheduled based on priority

Deadlock:
A situation where two or more processes are blocked forever, waiting for each other.

Deadlock Conditions (Coffman Conditions):
1. Mutual Exclusion
2. Hold and Wait
3. No Preemption
4. Circular Wait

Memory Management:
- Logical Address: Generated by CPU
- Physical Address: Address in memory unit
- Virtual Memory: Allows execution of processes not completely in memory

Paging:
Divides physical memory into fixed-size blocks called frames and logical memory into blocks called pages.
